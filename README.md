In my exploration of railway safety, my primary focus was on developing an image detection model capable of ensuring safety measures when trains enter stations. Collaborating with my partner, Ayushman, we embarked on a mission to enhance railway safety protocols using innovative technology.

One of our initial challenges involved sourcing the necessary images of railway stations autonomously. With determination and effort, we acquired an extensive dataset containing various scenarios depicting stations, tracks, and platforms, ensuring a diverse representation of real-world conditions.

Upon meticulous analysis, we identified and classified nine distinct classes relevant to our machine learning model. These classes encompassed crucial elements such as track clearance, platform safety, and other factors vital for ensuring the safe passage of trains within station premises.

To tackle this complex task of image classification and detection, we opted for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. CNNs are well-suited for image-related tasks due to their ability to automatically learn patterns and features within images, making them an ideal choice for our railway safety project.

By implementing the CNN model, we aimed to train the system to recognize and classify various safety-related elements within railway station images in real-time. The objective was to create a robust and accurate system that could detect potential hazards, assess track conditions, and ensure platform safety as trains approach stations.

Our ultimate goal with this innovative approach was to contribute significantly to railway safety measures by deploying a cutting-edge image detection system. Such technology holds the potential to minimize risks, enhance efficiency, and ultimately prioritize passenger and railway staff safety within station premises.
